  <!-- TREATMENT PROCESS -->
  <section>
    <h2 class="section-title">TREATMENTPROCCESS</h2>
    <div class="features-list">
      <ul>
        <li>Our pole processing begins with well-managed plantations, where trees are grown, harvested at maturity (8-15 years), and carefully selected for quality. The harvested poles are graded, debarked, and air-dried for up to six months to achieve the recommended 28% moisture content.</li>
        <li>This is followed by a pressure treatment process using Copper Chromium Arsenic (CCA), a highly effective wood preservative. The poles are loaded into a sealed treatment cylinder, where a vacuum removes air and moisture, allowing deeper penetration of the preservative.</li>
        <li>Under high pressure, CCA is forced into the wood structure, providing long-lasting protection against decay, insects, and harsh weather. Excess preservative is safely recovered or disposed of in accordance with NEMA environmental standards. This ensures durable, high-quality poles ready for fencing, electricity, construction and telecommunication use.</li>

  <!-- FROM STUMP TO STEM -->
  <section>
    <h2 class="section-subtitle">FROM STUMP TO STEM: THE CYCLE CONTINUES</h2>
    <div class="features-list">
      <ul>
        <li>At Intrepids Treated Poles LTD, sustainability is at the core of Lamu tree plantations. Unlike clear-cutting methods, our trees are selectively harvested in a way that encourages natural regrowth. Once a mature tree is cut, the stump remains alive and sends out new shoots—allowing the stem to regenerate without the need for replanting.</li>
        <li>This method, known as coppicing, ensures that we maintain a continuous and healthy cycle of growth while preserving soil structure and minimizing environmental impact. It’s a clear reflection that we don’t just cut trees—we nurture a renewable resource with long-term vision and care.</li>
