    <h3>Chain-Link Fencing</h3>
    <div class="features-list">
      <ul>
        <li>Chain-link fencing is a versatile and widely used option for both residential and commercial spaces.</li>
        <li>It provides clear visibility, is quick to install, and is relatively low-cost—making it ideal for boundary marking, schools, compounds, and light security applications.</li>
        <li>Pros: Affordable, durable, low maintenance, and allows visibility.</li>
        <li>Cons: Offers less privacy, and can be climbed or cut if not reinforced.</li>
        <li>Chain-link is a great mid-range option for clients who want secure, visible fencing on a budget.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Barbed Wire Fencing</h4>
    <div class="features-list">
      <ul>
        <li>Barbed wire fencing is a classic choice for agricultural and rural settings, particularly for controlling livestock movement. It’s mounted on strong treated poles and designed to act as a deterrent while enclosing large areas cost-effectively.</li>
        <li>Pros: Very affordable, simple to install, effective for livestock control.</li>
        <li>Cons: Can be harmful to animals or humans, not visually appealing, and offers limited security for high-risk areas.</li>
        <li>This is the most economical choice, best for large landowners and farm-based clients focused on function over aesthetics.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="image">

    <h5>High-Tension Electric Fencing</h5>
    <div class="features-list">
      <ul>
        <li>High tension electric fencing offers superior security and control, ideal for areas that face frequent intrusions whether from people or wildlife. It’s commonly used in farms, game reserves, and residential estates</li>
        <li>Pros: Provides maximum security, long-lasting, and requires minimal maintenance. Modern systems can be solar-powered, making them energy-efficient and cheaper to operate over time, especially in off-grid or remote areas.</li>
        <li>Cons: Higher initial installation cost and requires technical setup.</li>
        <li>It is the best option for regions affected by wild animals like elephants, offering an active deterrent that protects crops and property. With solar integration, clients reduce energy costs while maintaining reliable 24/7 protection. This is the premium choice for serious security needs.</li>
      </ul>
